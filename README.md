<h3>PURPOSE OF WEBSITE </h3>
<p> Based on the brief, the aim of the website (in both functionality and design) was produce a functional website that essentially showcases Caleb's music to current and new fans.</p>

<h3> The Initial stages </h3>
<P>     •	Researched Caleb Rex's social media to help me know what kind of design would bes suit him and his kind of music.</p>
<P>     •	Decided what pages were going to be on the website</p>
<P>     •	Sketched out a template for the header ad footer which was going to be repaeated on all the pages</p>
<P>     •	Then skecthed out ideas for the actual page content of each page</p>
<P>     •	Decided on the final design</p>

<h3> Page Layout </h3>
<P>     •	I decided to go with 5 different pages i.e about page, music page, </p>
<p>         videos page, photos page and contact page excluding the index page.</p>
<P>     •	The about page contains a row with two columns, one for the picture about </p>
<p>         Caleb and another column containing a few text about caleb and his music.</p>
<P>     •	The Music page contains two rows with three columns on each row which contain</p>
<p>         an audio file for a song and the corresponding cover photo forthe song </p>
<P>     •	The videos page contains two rows inside a container containing two music videos. </p>
<P>     •	The photos page contains 12 photos</p>
<P>     •	The contact us page contains a row with two columns one with a form for the user to fill</p>
<P>     	and another column showing alternative methods e.g phone number and email address</p>

<h3> Colors and Fonts </h3>
<P>     •   I decided to use popular Flat UI Colors from https://www.materialui.co/flatuicolors.</p>

<h3> Navigation </h3>
<p>     •   I chose to use a fixed navigation style, this allows for a user friendly experience on this site. </p>

<h3> HOW IT WAS TESTED </h3>
<h4> Summary </h4>
<p>     •	During and throughout the build, this was tested on google chrome using devTools, and testing responsiveness using the device toolbar.</p>
<p>     •	Also used the elements and style sections of the devTools to troubleshoot coding that seemed to affect my page layout when I couldn't quite work out what the issue was. My mentor reminded me of this tip.</p>
<p>     •	Also tested responsiveness by resizing the window everytime I implemented a new piece of code.</p>
<p>     •	AND also tested it physically viewing it on mobile, tablet, mac and windows laptop, windows desktop, and different browsers (firefox, safari, google chrome, opera)</p>

<h3> What was tested </h3>
<p>     •	External links to Calebs social media i.e facebook, twitter, instagram and youtube)</p>
<p>     •	Internal links (the navbar to ensure anchors were referenced to the right sections)</p>
<p>     •	Checked images to ensure they were responsive and displayed appropriately on smaller screens</p>
<p>     •	Ensuring content had no grammatical errors.</p>
<p>     •	Checked margins and padding of container (sections)</p>
<p>     •	Ensured the iframes were being responsive and displayed properly.</p>
<p>     •	HTML and CSS validation via w3.org.</p>

<h3> HOW IT WAS DEPLOYED </h3>
