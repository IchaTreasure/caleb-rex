<p> Build a static (front-end only) website for an artist named Caleb Rex. </p>

<h2>BREIF</h2>
<P>     •	Primary target audiences are the fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from the back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.</p>
<P>     •	Use the site to showcase the music and publicise availability to perform at events such as weddings and Concerts.</p>
<P>         The following assets to be showcased on the website:</p>

<P>     •	Two video clips</p>
<P>     •	Audio clips</p>
<P>     •	Links to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages etc.</p>

<h2>PURPOSE OF WEBSITE </h2>
<p> Based on the brief, the aim of the website (in both functionality and design) was produce a functional website that essentially showcases Caleb's music to current and new fans.</p>

<h2> The Initial stages </h2>
<P>     •	Researched Caleb Rex's social media to help me know what kind of design would best suit him and his kind of music.</p>
<P>     •	Decided what pages were going to be on the website</p>
<P>     •	Sketched out a template for the header and footer which was going to be repaeated on all the pages</p>
<P>     •	Then sketched out ideas for the actual page content of each page</p>
<P>     •	Decided on the final design</p>

<h2> Page Layout </h2>
<P>     •	I decided to go with 5 different pages i.e about page, music page, </p>
<p>         videos page, photos page and contact page excluding the index page.</p>
<P>     •	The about page contains a row with two columns, one for the picture about </p>
<p>         Caleb and another column containing a few text about caleb and his music.</p>
<P>     •	The Music page contains two rows with three columns on each row which contain</p>
<p>         an audio file for a song and the corresponding cover photo for the song </p>
<P>     •	The videos page contains two rows inside a container containing two music videos. </p>
<P>     •	The photos page contains 12 photos</p>
<P>     •	The contact us page contains a row with two columns one with a form for the user to fill</p>
<P>     	and another column showing alternative methods e.g phone number and email address</p>

<h2> Colors and Fonts </h2>
<P>     •   I decided to use popular Flat UI Colors from https://www.materialui.co/flatuicolorsto choose 
            the best color suitablefor the header and footer from popular websites</p>

<h2> Navigation </h2>
<p>     •   I choose to use a fixed navigation style, this allows for a user friendly experience on this site. </p>

<h2> HOW IT WAS TESTED </h2>
<h3> Summary </h3>
<p>     •	During the build, the website tested on google chrome using devTools, and testing responsiveness using the device toolbar.</p>
<p>     •	Also used the elements and style sections of the devTools to troubleshoot coding. </p>
<p>     •	Also tested responsiveness by resizing the window everytime I implemented a new piece of code.</p>
<p>     •	AND also tested it physically viewing it on mobile, tablet, mac and windows laptop, windows desktop, and different browsers (firefox, safari, google chrome, opera)</p>

<h2> What was tested </h2>
<p>     •	External links to Calebs social media i.e facebook, twitter, instagram and youtube</p>
<p>     •	Internal links (the navbar to ensure anchors were referenced to the right sections)</p>
<p>     •	Checked images to ensure they were responsive and displayed appropriately on smaller screens</p>
<p>     •	Ensuring content had no grammatical errors.</p>
<p>     •	Checked margins and padding of container (sections)</p>
<p>     •	Ensured the iframes were being responsive and displayed properly.</p>
<p>     •	HTML and CSS validation via w3.org.</p>

<h2> HOW IT WAS DEPLOYED </h2>
<p>     •	Used GitHub Pages to deploy final version (https://ichatreasure.github.io/caleb-rex)</p>
