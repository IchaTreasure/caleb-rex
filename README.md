<h3> THE PROJECT </h3>
<hr>
<h5> WHAT IS IT? </h5>
<hr>
<p> Build a static (front-end only) website for a 1960's rock band called The Monkees. For the purposes of this project, I have chosen to build a website for an artist named Caleb Rex. </p>

<h5>BREIF</h5>
<P> •	Primary target audiences are the fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from the back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.</p>
<P> •	Use the site to showcase the music and publicise availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.</p>
<P> •	The following assets to be showcased on the website:</p>
<P>     •	Photos</p>
<P>     •	Two video clips</p>
<P>     •	Audio clips</p>
<P>     •	Links to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages etc.</p>

<h5>PURPOSE OF WEBSITE </h5>
<p> Based on the brief, the aim of the website (in both functionality and design) was produce a functional website that essentially showcases Caleb's music to current and new fans.</p>

<h6> The Initial stages </h6>
<P>     •	Researched Caleb Rex's social media to help me know what kind of design would bes suit him and his kind of music.</p>
<P>     •	Decided what pages were going to be on the website</p>
<P>     •	Sketched out a template for the header ad footer which was going to be repaeated on all the pages</p>
<P>     •	Then skecthed out ideas for the actual page content of each page</p>
<P>     •	Decided on the final design</p>


<h6> Page Layout </h6>
<P>     •	I decided to go with 5 different pages i.e about page, music page, </p>
<p>         videos page, photos page and contact page excluding the index page.</p>
<P>     •	The about page contains a row with two columns, one for the picture about </p>
<p>         Caleb and another column containing a few text about caleb and his music.</p>
<P>     •	The Music page contains two rows with three columns on each row which contain</p>
<p>         an audio file for a song and the corresponding cover photo forthe song </p>
<P>     •	The videos page contains two rows inside a container containing two music videos. </p>
<P>     •	The photos page contains 12 photos</p>
<P>     •	The contact us page contains a row with two columns one with a form for the user to fill</p>
<P>     	and another column showing alternative methods e.g phone number and email address</p>


<h6> Colors and Fonts </h6>
<P>     •   I decided to use popular Flat UI Colors from https://www.materialui.co/flatuicolors.</p>
<p>     •   


<h6> Navigation </h6>
<p>     •   I chose to use a fixed navigation style, this allows for a user friendly experience on this site. </p>

<h6> Social Media in Footer</h6>
<p>     •   </p>
