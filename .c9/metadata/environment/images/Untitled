Rather refreshing to say the least, when we live in an era when a day without an Instagram \n                            is considered radio silence. </p>\n        \n                            <p>But over the past few years, the normally reclusive singer has released a series of quirky one-offs that hint she is re-entering the \n                            game. Then again, it could just be Fiona being Fiona. </p>\n                          \n                           <p>Last February she released a slice of meditative chamber pop, \"Left Handed Kisses,\" a duet with whistle-happy singer Andrew Bird. \n                            She then went off the radar for 10 months until she popped up on the list of artists for the We Rock with Standing Rock benefit \n                            in support of the members of the Standing Rock Sioux protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline. It was at that group's December show \n                            that she unveiled her vicious takedown of soon-to-be-inaugurated President Donald Trump, \"Trump's Nuts Roasting on an Open Fire.\"</p>\n        \n                           <p>She was not nearly done trolling the former Celebrity Apprentice host, though. In honor of January's Women's March, \n                            Apple made her feelings about Trump crystal clear with the biting original \"Tiny Hands.\" The sliver of a song was dropped \n                            in advance of the massive protest that drew millions around the globe and featured the unforgettable refrain, \n                            \"We don't want your tiny hands anywhere near our underpants.\"</p>\n                            \n                           <p>In 2018, she recorded a new song for the Carnegie Hall Lullaby Project’s latest Hopes and Dreams compilation. \n                            Titled “I Can’t Wait to Meet You,” written by Solange Jimenez and Thomas Cabaniss for the compilation, \n                            which pairs pregnant women and new mothers in hospitals, homeless shelters, schools, and prisons with professional \n                            musicians to record their music. Other artists featured on the compilation include Angélique Kidjo, Catherine Zeta-Jones, \n                            Rosanne Cash, Natalie Merchant, and more.</p>\n        \n                           <p>The project is done to support maternal health, aid child development, and foster a bond between mothers and children \n                            throughout New York City. Apple’s recording opens with a brief spoken word section by Jimenez before the bluesy songstress \n                            takes over. </p>\n                            \n                           <p>And if that didn't keep her busy enough, she joined Shirley Manson at the female-driven Girl School Festival in Los Angeles \n                            for a cover of \"You Don't Own Me\" by Lesley Gore, wearing a white T-shirt with \"KNEEL, PORTNOW\" written across it in ink. \n                            This was considered in response to Grammy head Neil Portnow's heavily criticized comments that women need to \"step up\" \n                            in order to earn more Grammy nods.\n                           </p>\n                      </div>\n                </div>\n
